## Section A05, Armin Schwartzman

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

I found the idea of certain activities being visible in the brains activity was very interesting. For instance, when we went to the fMRI center, we were told a story of how visitors were able to guess which hand was active based on the response shown in the fMRI.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

I would like the investigate the further extent of what we can find out using fMRI data, aside from basic hand movements. For instance, can we determine if the subject is thinking or working on something, like a task?

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

Our Q1 project involved identifying specific regions responsible for working memory, by taking data of subjects performing various working memory tasks. Therefore a change in approach we could take is the reverse of this: using brain region activity data in order to predict the type of working memory task being performed.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

Instead of using data we already have, it would be interesting to see if we could somehow acquire our own data. Or, as this may have been quite expensive and time-consuming, instead we can see what its like to take our own data by having ourselves perform a task under the fMRI machine.
